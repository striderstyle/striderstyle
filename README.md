-  please use tonetags with me if i don't know you that well or if we've just met !!
      <p align="center">
-  we have autism / adhd [both diagnosed professionaly /srs]
           <p align="center">
-  we are a system. we don't normally talk too much about it unless we're close with someone though 
                <p align="center">
-  we say RECLAIMABLE slurs but will stop if its against peoples boundaries
                                 <p align="center">
- very sensitive in terms of mean / hurtful comments so reminder to please use tonetags when joking around like that :)
                <p align="center">
                - if we don't reply to you then it's likely we're either asleep or afk. sometimes we may not reply entirely but i swear its just because we're probably busy
                                <p align="center">
                                - how we act really depends on how you may act towards us. if you're rude and insensitive we'll be rude and insensitive to you, you know what i mean right? :3 BUT normally we're actually really chill and wholesome, despite the fact that we say RECCLAAIMABLEEE slurs, sometimes, BUT JOKINGLY, it's never meant to be in mean way okaee
